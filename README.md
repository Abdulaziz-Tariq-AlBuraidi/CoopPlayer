# CoopPlayer 🎮

CoopPlayer is a SaaS platform designed to help gamers organize co-op gaming sessions, find committed teammates, and coordinate playtimes effortlessly.

The platform focuses on solving one of the most common problems in cooperative gaming: **unreliable participation and poor session coordination**.

---

## 🚀 Vision

Many gamers struggle to complete co-op games due to:
- Teammates canceling last minute
- Difficulty aligning schedules
- Lack of commitment in multiplayer sessions

CoopPlayer aims to solve this by providing a **session-based, commitment-driven platform** where players can plan, join, and complete co-op gaming experiences together.

---

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Current gaming platforms focus on matchmaking, but not on **commitment**.

Players often face:
- Incomplete co-op runs
- Random teammates with no accountability
- No structured way to plan recurring sessions
- Poor communication outside the game itself

CoopPlayer introduces structure, visibility, and accountability to co-op gaming.

---

## 🎯 Solution Overview

CoopPlayer allows players to:
- Create structured co-op sessions
- Define schedules and session rules
- Join sessions with clear commitment expectations
- Receive reminders and updates
- Track session progress and participation

This transforms casual co-op play into a **reliable, organized experience**.
